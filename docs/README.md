# JQL Documentation 📚

Welcome to the official documentation for **JQL (JSON Query Language)**. JQL is a high-performance, streaming-first projection engine designed for the high-intensity requirements of modern data pipelines.

## 🏁 Getting Started

If you are new to JQL, start here:

- [**Quick Start**](../README.md#getting-started) - Install and run your first query in 60 seconds.
- [**Query Language Guide**](query-language.md) - Learn the JQL syntax, aliasing, and directives.
- [**API Reference**](api-reference.md) - Deep dive into Runtimes, Adapters, and the Core Engine.

## 🚀 Performance & Architecture

Understand why JQL is the fastest JSON engine for the edge:

- [**Internals Deep-Dive**](internals.md) - Learn about GC-Free tokenization, binary line splitting, and object recycling.
- [**Performance Contract**](performance.md) - Our ironclad guarantees for time and memory complexity.

## 🛡️ Reliability & Roadmap

- [**Error Handling**](error-handling.md) - JQL's behavior with malformed JSON and corrupted streams.
- [**Project Roadmap**](roadmap.md) - Our vision for Enterprise Edge Adapters and future features.
